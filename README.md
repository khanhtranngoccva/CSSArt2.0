# CSSArt2.0

A repository containing my next-generation CSS artworks.

To access my artworks:
1. Visit the GitHub website https://khanhtranngoccva.github.io/CSSArt2.0/
2. Each artwork has its unique folder name. Add this name after the main URL.

Example:
https://khanhtranngoccva.github.io/CSSArt2.0/CupheadVonBonBon

## How it's made:
**Tech used:**
<img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=HTML5&color=red&logo=html5&labelColor=white" alt="HTML5"/>
<img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=CSS3&color=dodgerblue&logo=css3&labelColor=white&logoColor=dodgerblue" alt="CSS3"/>

1. For every artwork except 3D model creations, I create a unique, original sketch to maximize authenticity 
and art purity with the help of Autodesk Sketchbook.
2. The sketch is colored using the same software.
3. A copy of the artwork in pure CSS code is then generated by partially tracing on the original sketch.

## Optimizations:
- The CodePen editor and other browsers can be adjusted to different sizes, 
therefore my CSS works need to responsive across all viewport sizes. To achieve responsiveness, a NodeJS script 
is run to convert pixel lengths (px units) to length expressions using CSS variables.
- A master control variable (vmin units) that works with the length expressions mentioned above is used to dictate the size of the responsive artwork.

## Lesson learned:
- Practiced sketching and illustration.
- Gained experience with various CSS techniques: transforms, filters, positioning, border-radius,
outlines and borders, gradients,...
- Strengthened general problem solving skills.
